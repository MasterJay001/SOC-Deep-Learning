# Digit Classification | Softmax Regression | Multi-class regression
Basically we build a Multi-class Neural Network by training it over the train.csv dataset(include in the repository) along with test.csv,
and calculated its test and train accuracy along with the graph of cost vs no of iterations.

## Highlights
  First, we define the number of units of our layers. This is a 2 layer NN, so has one hidden layer and one softmax layer, both having 10 units of neurons. 
The input layer has n x n units, flattened, as all the sets are grey-scale, also having the label defining the number of that particular set.
  Finally, we use our simple way as logistic regressions, by initializing parameters, forward propagation, back propagation, updating parameters, decreasing the cost function, plotting the graph and getting out the accuracy.
  
## Results 
with learning rate= and iterations=
Train accuracy: 92%
Test accuracy:
